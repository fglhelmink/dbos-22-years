# What 22 Years of Data Reveal About Bipolar Disorder Risk
Assessing the Ongoing Risk of Mood Disorders in Individuals with Bipolar Disorder in the Family History

# Background and Overview
Understanding risk factors for severe mental health disorders is critical for early intervention and improved outcomes. For this study, we followed individuals at familial risk for bipolar disorder over a 22-year period â€” from adolescence into middle adulthood, tracking the progression of mood disorders and psychiatric symptoms. By analyzing long-term trends in mental health outcomes, we provide key insights into when individuals are most vulnerable and how risk evolves over time.

This write-up summarizes key findings from my published research in the Journal of the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry. Please note that it is tailored for an industry audience, so certain details and nuances may be omitted.

# Data Structure Overview
The data structure for this project is designed to support longitudinal analysis of offspring at risk for bipolar disorder, with five waves of assessment collected over 22 years. The key components of the data are as follows:

#### Cohort: The Dutch Bipolar Offspring Study
140 offspring of 86 parents with bipolar I (BD-I) or bipolar II (BD-II) disorder, ages 12-21 at baseline. A total of 100 offspring from 69 families still participated after 22 years (72% retention rate). At the 22-year follow-up, offspring had a mean age of 38 years (range 33-43 years) and 54% was female.  

#### Mood Episodes
Collected data includes information on lifetime prevalence of psychiatric disorders, age of onset, number of episodes, and episode duration for mood disorders, with a focus on major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder. 

These data allow us to examine lifetime and point prevalence, mood disorder trends across age, how one psychiatric episode can lead to another, and comorbidity.
